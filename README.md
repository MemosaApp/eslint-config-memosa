eslint-config-memosa
--------------------

JavaScript coding standards for Memosa apps.

# Usage

We export a base set of rules for your ESLint configuration:

```
yarn install eslint-config-memosa
```

Add `"extends": "memosa"` to your .eslintrc.

# Improving this configuration

Consider adding test cases if you're making complicated rules changes, like
anything involving regexes.

You can run tests with `npm test`.

You can make sure this module lints with itself using `npm run lint`.
